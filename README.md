The Gordian system is all about user agency & security. It's intended to support the self-sovereign control of digital assets in a way that's safe, secure, and private by enabling responsible key management, [cutting through a traditionally knotty problem in Bitcoin development.](Architecture/Why-Gordian.md). The Gordian system is built on a foundation of Principles that have been fulfilled in an Architecture that is embodied in Reference Apps and supported by Reference Libraries.

* **Gordian Principles.** A mission statement of four core principles that support self-sovereign control of digital assets.
* **Gordian Architecture.** The design for both the overall architecture and the individual specifications that make it possible.
* **Gordian Reference Apps.** A set of applications that demonstrate the Gordian Architecture, its Principles, its specifications, and its Libraries.
* **Gordian Reference Libraries.** A set of libraries that allow developers to incorporate Gordian specifications and expand the Gordian ecosystem.
* **#SmartCustody.** Educational programs meant to support the Gordian Principles.

The ultimate goal of the Gordian System is to create a community of developers who have followed the examples of the Gordian Reference Apps and used the Gordian Reference Libraries to build their own applications that embody the Gordian Architecture and fulfill the Gordian Principles.

*This repo contains a table of contents for various the Gordian system projects and features. Please see individual repos and pages for more information.*

*You can also join our [Signal Group, GitHub Discussions, or low-volume announcement list for Gordian Developers](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/subscribe.html#gordian-developers).*

## Gordian Principles

Blockchain Commons' interoperable specifications are meant to support four core principles that put the user first and that enable responsible key management:

* **Independence.** Gordian improves user freedom from involuntary oversight or external control.
* **Privacy.** Gordian protects against coercion with non-correlation, privacy, and pseudonymity.
* **Resilience.** Gordian protects users to decrease the likelihood of them losing their funds via any means.
* **Openness.** Gordian supports open infrastructure that allows developers to create their own applications.

Look at individual Blockchain Commons reference apps for guidance on how each acts as a model for these principles and [#SmartCustody Case Studies](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Case-Studies-Overview.md) for how professional hardware & software apps do so.

## Gordian Architecture

The Gordian Architecture puts the Gordian Principles into use through an overall design that covers everything that from the high-level architecture of a Gordian ecosystem through the specification and UX best practices that make it possible.

* **Gordian Macro-Architecture.** The ecosystem architecture depends on functional partition, separating services and confidential data.
   * The Macro-Architecture is built primarily to support _Privacy_ through these features.
   * It is also built on a concept of _Openness_ where different Services from different developers will interoperate freely.
* **Data Format.** [CBOR](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/introduction/Why-CBOR/) is used as the canonical data structure for the Gordian Architecture.
* **Encoding Specifications.** Bytewords, URs, and (optionally) [Animated](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/devs/animated-qrs.html) or Static QRs ensure that Gordian services are interoperable.
   * The Encoding Specifications are how the Gordian System ensures _Openness_ in its Macro-Architure.
* **Backup Specifications.** UR specifications make it easy to backup confidential data.
  * Supporting backups of data improves the _Resilience_ of that data.
* **Communication Specifications.** Further UR specifications such as [Gordian Envelope](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/introduction/Envelope-Intro/) and request/responses aid interoperable communication.
   * Like the Encoding Specifications, Communication Specifications help to suport the _Openness_ of the architecture.
   * They also ensure _Independence_ because they assure the portability of data.
* **Secure UX Designs.** UX best practices form another layer of support for the Gordian Principles.
   * Good UX designs help _Resilience_ by proofing a user against mistake or con-men attacks of various sorts.
   * They also improve _Independence_ by making it easier for a user to control their own destiny.

Please see [The Gordian Architecture](/Architecture/README.md) for more in-depth discussion of all the architectural elements and [Gordian Architecture Roles](/Architecture/Roles.md) for examples of functions that can be partitioned within the Macro-architecture. Also see [Collaborative Seed Recovery (CSR) Overview](CSR/README.md) for our largest current architectual project in 2022 and [Collaborative Key Management (CKM) Overview](CKM/README.md) for our planned next step in 2023-2024.

Together, these elements (in particular: a network coordinator such as Gordian Coordinator; a signing device such as Gordian Seed Tool; encoding specifications such URs; and communication specifications such as envelope, request, and response) comprise what we consider a Minimal Viable Architecture (MVA) for Gordian, and thus for safe, self-sovereign architecture. They're the minimum that's needed to properly support users.

### Use Cases

Use Cases further describe the intent of Blockchain Commons' architecture.

## Gordian Reference Apps

Gordian Reference Apps demonstrate the elements of how the Gordian Architecture and how they can be used to fulfill the Gordian Principles. Our Gordian Reference Apps undergoing the most development currently include:

* **Gordian Coordinator.** A Networked transaction coordinator.
   * Demonstrates _Independence_ and _Privacy_ by empowering users to create their own transactions, potentially in a non-Networked way.
   * Demonstrates _Openness_ through use of Communication Specifications such as URs.
   * Improves _Resilience_ through support for multi-sigs.
* **Gordian Seed Tool.** An Airgapped seed vault & signing device.
   * Allows for _Independence_ and _Resilience_ by storing user assets in a Closely Held device.
   * Demonstrates _Openness_ through the use of Communication Specifications such as URs.
   * Improves _Resilience_ through Sharding and Backup Specifications.
* **SpotBit.** A Micro-pricing service.
   * Demonstrates the _Openness_ of a digital-asset ecosystem that supports Microservices.
   * Improves _Privacy_ through the user of a Torgap.
   * Improves _Independence_ by removing centralization of price-lookups.

Please see [The Gordian Reference Apps](/Architecture/Apps.md) for a complete list of past and present reference apps, links to their repos, and an example of how they can be combined into a Macro-Architecture. Links to CLI apps are also included.

## Gordian Reference Libraries

The Gordian Reference Libraries allow you to easily use many of the specifications that lay the foundation for the Gordian Architecture. Our foundational libraries are usually written in C or C++, but many have many converted in other languages such as Java, Python, and Swift.

The core libraries are:

* **bc-bytewords.** A library for encoding binary data into Bytewords. A Gordian _Encoding Specification_.
* **bc-lifehash.** A library for creating Lifehash visual hashes. A Gordian _UX Design_.
* **bc-sskr.** A library for sharding a secret and converting it to Bytewords or URs. A Gordian _Backup Specification_.
* **bc-ur.** A library for encoding binary data as URs. A Gordian _Encoding Specification_.

Please see [The Gordian Reference Libraries](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons#gordian-reference-libraries) for a complete list of libraries in a variety of languages.

## Module Dependencies

* [This document](SwiftDependencies.md) details the dependencies between many of our reference libraries and apps in the Swift/iOS/macOS ecosystem. Many of the higher-level libraries are written in Swift, while there are a number of important lower-level libraries that are written in C or C++.
