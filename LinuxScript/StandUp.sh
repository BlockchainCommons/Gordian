# DISCLAIMER: It is not a good idea to store large amounts of Bitcoin on a VPS,
# ideally you should use this as a watch-only wallet. This script is expiramental
# and has not been widely tested. The creators are not responsible for loss of
# funds. If you are not familiar with running a node or how Bitcoin works then we
# urge you to use this in testnet so that you can use it as a learning tool.

# This script installs the latest stable version of Tor, Bitcoin Core,
# Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW), debian updates, enables automatic updates for
# debian for good security practices, installs a random number generator, and
# optionally a QR encoder and an image displayer.

# The script will display the uri in plain text which you can convert to a QR Code
# yourself. It is highly recommended to add a Tor V3 pubkey for cookie authentication
# so that even if your QR code is compromised an attacker would not be able to access
# your node.

# StandUp.sh sets Tor and Bitcoin Core up as systemd services so that they start
# automatically after crashes or reboots. By default it sets up a pruned testnet node,
# a Tor V3 hidden service controlling your rpcports and enables the firewall to only
# allow incoming connections for SSH. If you supply a SSH_KEY in the arguments
# it allows you to easily access your node via SSH using your rsa pubkey, if you add
# SYS_SSH_IP's it will only accept SSH connections from those IP's.

# StandUp.sh will create a user called standup, and assign the optional password you
# give it in the arguments.

# StandUp.sh will create two logs in your root directory, to read them run:
# $ cat standup.err
# $ cat standup.log

####
#0. Prerequisites
####

# In order to run this script you need to be logged in as root, and enter in the commands
# listed below:
# (the $ represents a terminal commmand prompt, do not actually type in a $)

# First you need to give the root user a password:
# $ sudo passwd

# Then you need to switch to the root user:
# $ su - root

# Then create the file for the script:
# $ nano standup.sh

# Nano is a text editor that works in a terminal, you need to paste the entire contents
# of this script into your terminal after running the above command,
# then you can type:
# control x (this starts to exit nano)
# y (this confirms you want to save the file)
# return (just press enter to confirm you want to save and exit)

# Then we need to make sure the script can be executable with:
# $ chmod +x standup.sh

# After that you can run the script with the optional arguments like so:
# $ ./standup.sh "insert pubkey" "insert node type (see options below)" "insert ssh key" "insert ssh allowed IP's" "insert password for standup user"

####
# 1. Set Initial Variables from command line arguments
####

# The arguments are read as per the below variables:
# ./standup.sh "PUBKEY" "BTCTYPE" "SSH_KEY" "SYS_SSH_IP" "USERPASSWORD"

# If you want to omit an argument then input empty qoutes in its place for example:
# ./standup "" "Mainnet" "" "" "aPasswordForTheUser"

# If you do not want to add any arguments and run everything as per the defaults simply run:
# ./standup.sh

# For Tor V3 client authentication (optional), you can run standup.sh like:
# ./standup.sh "descriptor:x25519:NWJNEFU487H2BI3JFNKJENFKJWI3"
# and it will automatically add the pubkey to the authorized_clients directory, which
# means the user is Tor authenticated before the node is even installed.
PUBKEY=$1

# Can be one of the following: "Mainnet", "Pruned Mainnet", "Testnet", "Pruned Testnet", or "Private Regtest", default is "Pruned Testnet"
BTCTYPE=$2

# Optional key for automated SSH logins to standup non-privileged account - if you do not want to add one add "" as an argument
SSH_KEY=$3

# Optional comma separated list of IPs that can use SSH - if you do not want to add any add "" as an argument
SYS_SSH_IP=$4

# Optional password for the standup non-privileged account - if you do not want to add one add "" as an argument
USERPASSWORD=$5

# Force check for root, if you are not logged in as root then the script will not execute
if ! [ "$(id -u)" = 0 ]
then

  echo "$0 - You need to be logged in as root!"
  exit 1

# 4. Install latest stable tor
####

# Download tor

#  To use source lines with https:// in /etc/apt/sources.list the apt-transport-https package is required. Install it with:

DEBIAN_VERSION=$(lsb_release -c | awk '{ print $2 }')

# You need to add the following entries to /etc/apt/sources.list:
cat >> /etc/apt/sources.list << EOF
deb https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org $DEBIAN_VERSION main
deb-src https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org $DEBIAN_VERSION main

# Then add the gpg key used to sign the packages by running:
sudo curl https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org/A3C4F0F979CAA22CDBA8F512EE8CBC9E886DDD89.asc | gpg --import
